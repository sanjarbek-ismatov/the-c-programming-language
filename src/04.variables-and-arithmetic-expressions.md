## 1.2 Variables and Arithmetic Expressions

The next program uses the formula **°C = (5/9)(°F-32)** to print the following table of Fahrenheit temperatures and their centigrade or Celsius equivalents:

```
  1  -17
 20   -6
 40    4
 60   15
 80   26
100   37
120   48
140   60
160   71
180   82
200   93
220  104
240  115
260  126
280  137
300  148
```

The program itself still consists of the definition of a single function named `main`. It is longer than the one that printed **hello, world**, but not complicated. It introduces several new ideas, including *comments*, *declarations*, *variables*, *arithmetic expressions*, *loops*, and *formatted output*.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table
for fahr = 0, 20, ..., 300 */
main()
{
        int fahr, celsius;
        int lower, upper, step;
        lower = 0; /* lower limit of temperature scale */
        upper = 300; /* upper limit */
        step = 20; /* step size */
        fahr = lower;
        while (fahr <= upper) {
                celsius = 5 * (fahr-32) / 9;
                printf("%d\t%d\n", fahr, celsius);
                fahr = fahr + step;
        }
}
```

The two lines

```c
/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table
for fahr = 0, 20, ..., 300 */
```

are a ***comment***, which in this case explains briefly what the program does. Any characters between `/*` and `*/` are ignored by the compiler; they may be used freely to make a program easier to understand. *Comments may appear anywhere where a blank, tab or newline can.*

In C, **all variables must be declared before they are used**, usually at the beginning of the function before any executable statements. A *declaration* announces the properties of variables; it consists of a *type* and a *list of variables*, such as

```c
int fahr, celsius;
int lower, upper, step;
```

The type `int` means that the variables listed are *integers*; by contrast with `float`, which means *floating point*, i.e., numbers that may have a fractional part. The range of both `int` and `float` depends on the machine you are using; *16-bit ints*, which lie between -32768 and +32767, are common, as are *32-bit ints*. A `float` number is typically a *32-bit quantity*, with at least six significant digits and magnitude generally between about 10^-38 and 10^38.

C provides several other data types besides `int` and `float`, including:

| **Type**    | **Description**                    |
|-------------|------------------------------------|
| `char`      | *character* - a single byte        |
| `short`     | *short integer*                    |
| `long`      | *long integer*                     |
| `double`    | *double-precision floating point*  |

The size of these objects is also *machine-dependent*. There are also *arrays*, *structures*, and *unions* of these basic types, *pointers* to them, and *functions* that return them, all of which we will meet in due course.

Computation in the temperature conversion program begins with the *assignment statements*:

```c
lower = 0;
upper = 300;
step = 20;
```

which set the variables to their *initial values*. Individual statements are terminated by *semicolons*.

Each line of the table is computed the same way, so we use a *loop* that repeats once per output line; this is the purpose of the **while** loop.

```c
while (fahr <= upper) {
                ...
}
```

The **while** loop operates as follows: The *condition* in parentheses is tested. If it is *true* (`fahr` is less than or equal to `upper`), the *body of the loop* (the three statements enclosed in braces) is executed. Then the condition is re-tested, and if true, the body is executed again. When the test becomes *false* (`fahr` exceeds `upper`) the loop ends, and execution continues at the statement that follows the loop. There are no further statements in this program, so it terminates.

The body of a **while** can be one or more statements enclosed in braces, as in the temperature converter, or a single statement without braces, as in

```c
while (i < j)
                i = 2 * i;
```

In either case, we will always *indent* the statements controlled by the **while** by one tab stop (which we have shown as four spaces) so you can see at a glance which statements are inside the loop. The indentation emphasizes the *logical structure* of the program. Although C compilers do not care about how a program looks, **proper indentation and spacing are critical** in making programs easy for people to read. We recommend writing only one statement per line, and using blanks around operators to clarify grouping. The position of braces is less important, although people hold passionate beliefs. *Pick a style that suits you, then use it consistently.*

Most of the work gets done in the body of the loop. The Celsius temperature is computed and assigned to the variable `celsius` by the statement

```c
celsius = 5 * (fahr-32) / 9;
```

The reason for multiplying by 5 and dividing by 9 instead of just multiplying by 5/9 is that in C, as in many other languages, *integer division truncates*: any fractional part is discarded. Since 5 and 9 are integers, `5/9` would be truncated to zero and so all the Celsius temperatures would be reported as zero.

This example also shows a bit more of how `printf` works. `printf` is a *general-purpose output formatting function*, which we will describe in detail in [Chapter 7](). Its first argument is a *string of characters to be printed*, with each `%` indicating where one of the other (second, third, ...) arguments is to be substituted, and in what form it is to be printed. For instance, `%d` specifies an *integer argument*, so the statement

```c
printf("%d\t%d\n", fahr, celsius);
```

causes the values of the two integers `fahr` and `celsius` to be printed, with a *tab* (`\t`) between them.

Each `%` construction in the first argument of `printf` is paired with the corresponding second argument, third argument, etc.; *they must match up properly by number and type*, or you will get wrong answers.

By the way, `printf` is *not part of the C language*; there is no input or output defined in C itself. `printf` is just a useful function from the *standard library* of functions that are normally accessible to C programs. The behaviour of `printf` is defined in the *ANSI standard*, however, so its properties should be the same with any compiler and library that conforms to the standard.

In order to concentrate on C itself, we don't talk much about input and output until Chapter 7. In particular, we will defer formatted input until then. If you have to input numbers, read the discussion of the function `scanf` in Section 7.4. `scanf` is like `printf`, except that it *reads input instead of writing output*.

There are a couple of problems with the temperature conversion program. The simpler one is that the output isn't very pretty because the numbers are not right-justified. That's easy to fix; if we augment each `%d` in the `printf` statement with a *width*, the numbers printed will be right-justified in their fields. For instance, we might say

```c
printf("%3d %6d\n", fahr, celsius);
```

to print the first number of each line in a field *three digits wide*, and the second in a field *six digits wide*, like this:

```
 0    -17
 20    -6
 40     4
 60    15
 80    26
100    37
...
```
The more serious problem is that because we have used integer arithmetic, the Celsius temperatures are not very accurate; for instance, 0°F is actually about -17.8°C, not -17. To get more accurate answers, we should use *floating-point arithmetic* instead of integer. This requires some changes in the program. Here is the second version:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table
for fahr = 0, 20, ..., 300; floating-point version */
main()
{
        float fahr, celsius;
        float lower, upper, step;
        lower = 0; /* lower limit of temperature scale */
        upper = 300; /* upper limit */
        step = 20; /* step size */
        fahr = lower;
        while (fahr <= upper) {
                celsius = (5.0/9.0) * (fahr-32.0);
                printf("%3.0f %6.1f\n", fahr, celsius);
                fahr = fahr + step;
        }
}
```

This is much the same as before, except that `fahr` and `celsius` are declared to be *float* and the formula for conversion is written in a more natural way. We were unable to use `5/9` in the previous version because integer division would truncate it to zero. A decimal point in a constant indicates that it is *floating point*, however, so `5.0/9.0` is not truncated because it is the ratio of two floating-point values.

If an arithmetic operator has integer operands, an *integer operation* is performed. If an arithmetic operator has one *floating-point operand* and one *integer operand*, however, the integer will be converted to floating point before the operation is done. If we had written `(fahr-32)`, the `32` would be automatically converted to floating point. Nevertheless, writing floating-point constants with explicit decimal points even when they have integral values emphasizes their floating-point nature for human readers.

The detailed rules for when integers are converted to floating point are in Chapter 2. For now, notice that the assignment

```c
fahr = lower;
```

and the test

```c
while (fahr <= upper)
```

also work in the natural way — the `int` is converted to *float* before the operation is done.

The `printf` conversion specification `%3.0f` says that a floating-point number (here `fahr`) is to be printed at least three characters wide, with no decimal point and no fraction digits. `%6.1f` describes another number (`celsius`) that is to be printed at least six characters wide, with 1 digit after the decimal point. The output looks like this:

```
  0  -17.8
 20   -6.7
 40    4.4
...
```
Width and precision may be omitted from a specification: `%6f` says that the number is to be at least six characters wide; `%.2f` specifies two characters after the decimal point, but the width is not constrained; and `%f` merely says to print the number as floating point.

| **Format**   | **Description**                                         |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `%d`         | *Print as decimal integer*                             |
| `%6d`        | *Print as decimal integer, at least 6 characters wide* |
| `%f`         | *Print as floating point*                              |
| `%6f`        | *Print as floating point, at least 6 characters wide*  |
| `%.2f`       | *Print as floating point, 2 digits after decimal point*|
| `%6.2f`      | *Print as floating point, at least 6 wide and 2 after decimal point* |

Among others, `printf` also recognizes `%o` for *octal*, `%x` for *hexadecimal*, `%c` for *character*, `%s` for *character string*, and `%%` for itself.
